# Power Distribution Unit for Aristotle University Racing Team Electric (ARISTURTLE)

In this repository anyone can found all the CAD files for the power distribution unit / splitter box used by ARISTURTLE in the electric racing car of 2017-2018, called Irida. This project was made in collaboration with Iakovos Koutris. 

## Brief Explanation

The power distribution unit is a *3D-printed box*, containing all the necessary connections for splitting the *DC High Voltage* from the battery of the racecar in order to supply the two inverters of the car. It also contains the **discharge circuit** for the DC link capacitors of the inverters the **TSAL** and the energy meter for the Formula Student competitions. TSAL stands for Tractive System Active Light and is a system that constantly checks if the high voltage of the car is activated and red LEDs blink on the top of the car. If there is no high voltage a green LED turns on.

# Power Distribution Unit for Aristotle University Racing Team Electric (ARISTURTLE)

In this repository anyone can found all the CAD files for the power distribution unit / splitter box used by ARISTURTLE in the electric racing car of 2017-2018, called Irida. This project was made in collaboration with Iakovos Koutris. 

### Brief Explanation

The power distribution unit is a *3D-printed box*, containing all the necessary connections for splitting the *DC High Voltage* from the battery of the racecar in order to supply the two inverters of the car, by splitting the positive and negative pole to two supply lines. It also contains the **discharge circuit** for the DC link capacitors of the inverters the **BSPD** (Brake System Plausibility Device), the **energy meter** for the Formula Student competitions and the **HVD** (High Voltage Disconnect). Below you can see the **powertrain** of the racecar. The top container is the *power distribution unit*.

### Structural 

The power distribution unit is *3D-printed*, thing that gives facility for many configurations. The construction is composed of 6 pieces, due to the 3D printer restrictions, that were glued together. The box is made of ABS, due to its low weight, its high temperature resistance and because its electrically non conductive. An exploded view of the splitter box can be seen below.
